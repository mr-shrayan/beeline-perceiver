# beeline-perceiver


<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h3>

Beeline Perceiver. As the name suggests that it decides the shortest path to traverse between 2 points. This is based on the problem of humans to decide what is the shortest path between 2 points. The algorithms used are listed below

<h3>ALGORITHMS USED:</h3>

1) BREADTH FIRST SEARCH: Breadth First Search - Simple & Efficient Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
2) Best First Search - Faster, Heuristic-Heavy of A* Algorithm Does Not Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
3) A* - Combination of Dijikstra's and Breadth First Search Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
4) Dijikstra's - Father of PathFinding Algorithm Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
5) Swarm Algorithm - Combination of Dijikstra and A* Does Not Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
6) Convergent Swarm Algorithm - Faster, Heuristic-Heavy version of Swarm Does Not Guarantees Shortest Path.<br>
7) Bidirectional Swarm Algorithm - Swarm From Both Sides Genrally, Does Not Guarantee the Shortest Path. But in this Implementation it will Find Shortest Path(May Be Not in some Cases)<br>

<h3>APPLICATIONS:</h3>

Artifial Intelligence(Is used to Search through the State Space while developing an Autonomous Agent.<br>
COMPUTER SCIENCE ( used to solve hard problems using State Space Eg. TSP,SAT,etc....<br>
Daily Life: Google Maps.<br>
